# Higher or Lower Game

The **Higher or Lower Game** is a Python-based game where players compare the follower counts of two famous people and guess which one has more followers on social media. The game continues as long as the player guesses correctly. If the player guesses wrong, the game ends and their score is displayed.

The game is a simple and fun way to practice basic Python programming concepts such as functions, conditionals, loops, and working with external data.

## Features
- Randomly selects two people to compare in each round.
- Presents a description of each person along with their country.
- The player must choose between 'A' or 'B' to guess who has more followers.
- Tracks the player's score, with a game-over screen showing the final score when the player guesses incorrectly.
- Input validation to ensure the user types either 'A' or 'B'.
- Prompts players to choose between valid options if an invalid input is entered.
